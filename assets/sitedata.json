      "content": "Once Jekyll is running, you can start with basic configuration by adding various entries to _config.yml. \nBesides the documentation here, you can also read the annotated config file.\n\nWhen making changes to _config.yml, it is necessary to restart the Jekyll process for changes to take effect.\n\n\n  Setting url and baseurl    \n      GitHub Pages\n    \n  \n  Changing accent colors and sidebar images    \n      Theme color\n    \n  \n  Changing fonts    \n      Removing Google Fonts\n    \n  \n  Choosing a blog layout    \n      Using the blog layout in a subdirectory\n    \n  \n  Adding an author    \n      Adding an author’s picture\n      Adding social media icons\n      Adding an email, RSS icon or download icon\n    \n  \n  Enabling comments\n  Enabling Google Analytics    \n      Using a custom analytics provider\n    \n  \n  Changing built-in strings\n  Adding legal documents\n  Enabling math blocks\n  Adding custom Favicons and App Icons    \n      Changing the Favicon\n      Changing the App Icons\n    \n  \n  Adding a cookies banner*\n  Enabling newsletter boxes*\n  Enabling Dark Mode*\n\n\nSetting url and baseurl\nThe first order of business should be to set the correct url and baseurl values in _config.yml.\n\nThe url is the domain of your site, including the protocol (http or https). For this site, it is\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nurl: https://qwtel.com\n\n\nYou don’t need to provide this property when hosting on GitHub Pages or Netlify.\n\nIf your entire Jekyll blog is hosted in a subdirectory of your page, provide the path in baseurl with a leading /, but no trailing /,\ne.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nbaseurl: /hydejack\n\n\nOtherwise, provide the empty string ''\n\nYou don’t need to provide this property when hosting on GitHub Pages or Netlify.\n\nGitHub Pages\nWhen hosting on GitHub Pages the url is https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io\n(unless you are using a custom domain).\n\nThe baseurl depends on the kind of page you are hosting.\n\n\n  When hosting a user or organization page, use the empty string ''.\n  When hosting project page, use /&lt;reponame&gt;.\n\n\nFor for information on the types of pages you can host on GitHub, see the\nGitHub Help article.\n\nChanging accent colors and sidebar images\nHydejack allows you to choose the background image of the sidebar, as well as the accent color\n(color of the links, selection and focus outline, etc…).\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\naccent_image: /assets/img/sidebar-bg.jpg\naccent_color: rgb(79,177,186)\n\n\nI recommend using a blurred image in order for the text to remain readable.\nIf you save a blurred image as JPG, it will also drastically reduce its file size.\n\nThe accent_image property also accepts the special value none which will remove the default image.\n\nIf your sidebar image contains bright colors, the white text can be difficult to read. In this case, consider setting\ninvert_sidebar: true in the front matter to invert the text colors in the sidebar. \nUse front matter defaults to enable this on all pages (see below).\n\nNote that these values can be overwritten on a per-page basis, i.e. you can create a unique look for each page.\nYou can also apply a certain look to all posts in a category via front matter defaults, e.g.:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      path:         hydejack/\n    values:\n      accent_image: /assets/img/hydejack-bg.jpg\n      accent_color: rgb(38,139,210)\n\n\nTheme color\nHydejack also supports the theme_color property. When set, it will change the background color of the sidebar, as well as set the theme_color property in the Web App Manifest. In some browsers, such as Chrome on Android, this will change the color of the browser’s UI components.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ntheme_color:  rgb(25,55,71)\n\n\nJust like accent_* properties, the theme color can be overridden on a per-page basis by setting it in the front matter.\n\nChanging fonts\nHydejack lets you configure the font of regular text and headlines, and it has built-in support for Google Fonts.\nThere are three keys in _config.yml associated with this: font, font_heading and google_fonts.\nThe defaults are:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nfont:         Noto Sans, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\nfont_heading: Roboto Slab, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\ngoogle_fonts: Roboto+Slab:700|Noto+Sans:400,400i,700,700i\n\n\nfont and font_heading must be valid CSS font-family values. When using Google Fonts make sure to provide at least one fallback.\n\nThe google_fonts key is the string necessary to fetch the fonts from Google.\nYou can get it from the download page at Google Fonts after you’ve selected one or more fonts:\n\n\n\nRemoving Google Fonts\nIf you prefer not to use Google Fonts and remove all associated code from the site,\nset the google_fonts key to false.\n\nThe no_google_fonts parameter has been removed in v9 and no longer has any effect.\n\nChoosing a blog layout\nHydejack features three layouts for showing your blog posts.\n\n\n  The list layout only shows the title and groups the posts by year of publication.\n  The grid layout* is exclusive to the PRO Version and will show a content card (with image) for each post.\n  The blog layout is a traditional paginated layout and shows the title and an excerpt of each post.\n\n\nIn order to use the list or grid layout add the following front-matter to a new markdown file:\n\n---\nlayout: list # or `grid`\ntitle:  Home\n---\n\n\nIf you want to use the blog layout, you need to add jekyll-paginate to your Gemfile and to the plugins list in your config file:\n\n# file: `Gemfile`\ngem \"jekyll-paginate\"\n\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-paginate\n\n\nYou also need to add the paginate and paginate_path keys to your config file, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\npaginate:      10\npaginate_path: '/:num/'\n\n\nThe blog layout needs to be applied to a file with the .html file extension\nand the paginate_path needs to match the path to the index.html file.\nTo match the paginate_path above, put a index.html with the following front matter in the root directory:\n\n# file: `index.html`\n---\nlayout: blog\ntitle: Blog\n---\n\n\nFor more information see Pagination.\n\nUsing the blog layout in a subdirectory\nIf you want to use the blog layout at a URL like /my-blog/, create the following folder structure:\n\n├── my-blog\n│   └── index.html\n└── _config.yml\n\n\nYou can use the same index.html as before and place it in the subdirectory.\n\n# file: `my-blog/index.html`\n---\nlayout: blog\ntitle: Blog\n---\n\n\nIn your config file, make sure the paginate_path matches the name of the subdirectory:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\npaginate:      10\npaginate_path: /my-blog/:num/ #!!\n\n\nTo add an entry in the sidebar to your blog directory, see Adding an entry to the sidebar.\n\nAdding an author\nAt a bare minimum, you should add an author key with a name and email sub-key\n(used by the feed plugin) to to your config file:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  name:  Florian Klampfer\n  email: mail@qwtel.com\n\n\nIf you would like the author to be displayed in the about section below a post or project*, add an about key and provide markdown content. I recommend using the YAML pipe | syntax, so you can include multiple paragraphs:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  name:  Florian Klampfer\n  email: mail@qwtel.com\n  about: |\n    Hi, I'm Florian or @qwtel...\n\n    This is another paragraph.\n\n\nAdding an author’s picture\nIf you’d like for the author’s picture to appear in addition the about text (see above), you can either use the jekyll-avatar plugin or provide URLs to images manually.\n\nTo use the plugin, add it to your Gemfile and the list of plugins in your config file:\n\n# file: `Gemfile`\ngem \"jekyll-avatar\"\n\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-avatar\n\n\nRun bundle install for the changes to take effect.\n\nMake sure you have provided a GitHub username in your config file (github_username),\nor to the author key (author.social.github, author.github.username, or author.github).\nSee Adding social media icons for more.\n\nTo set an image manually, you have to provide an URL to the author’s picture key:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  picture:  /assets/img/me.jpg\n\n\nIf you’d like to provide multiple versions for screens with different pixel densities,\nyou can provide path and srcset keys instead:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  picture:\n    path:   /assets/img/me.jpg\n    srcset:\n      1x:   /assets/img/me.jpg\n      2x:   /assets/img/me@2x.jpg\n\n\nThe keys of the srcset hash will be used as image descriptors. For more information on srcset, see the documentation at MDN, or this article from CSS-Tricks.\n\nAdding social media icons\nHydejack supports a variety of social media icons out of the box. These are defined on a per-author basis, so make sure you’ve followed the steps in Adding an author.\n\nIf you are using the gem-based version of Hydejack, download social.yml and put it into _data in the root directory. This is necessary because gem-based themes do not support including _data.\n\nYou can add a link to a social network by adding an entry to the social key in to an author.\nIt consists of the name of the social network as key and your username within that network as value, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  social:\n    twitter: qwtel\n    github:  qwtel\n\n\nCheck out authors.yml to see which networks are available.\nYou can also follow the steps here to add your own social media icons.\n\nYou can change the order in which the icons appear by moving lines up or down, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  social:\n    github:  qwtel # now github appears first\n    twitter: qwtel\n\n\nTo get an overview of which networks are available and how a typical username in that network looks like,\nsee the included authors.yml.\n\nShould providing a username not produce a correct link for some reason, you can provide a complete URL instead, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  social:\n    youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu0PYX_kVANdmgIZ4bw6_kA\n\n\nYou can add any platform, even if it’s not defined in social.yml, by providing a complete URL. However, a fallback icon  will be used when no icon is available. Supplying your own icons is an advanced topic.\n\nAdding an email, RSS icon or download icon\nIf you’d like to add an email , RSS , or download  icon to the list, add the email, rss, or download key, e.g.:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  social:\n    email:    mail@qwtel.com\n    rss:      https://ralphreijs.github.io/feed.xml # make sure you provide an absolute URL\n    download: https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack/archive/v9.1.6.zip\n\n\nEnabling comments\nHydejack supports comments via Disqus. Before you can add comments to a page you need to register and add your site to Disqus’ admin console. Once you have obtained your “Disqus shortname”, you include it in your config file:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndisqus: &lt;disqus shortname&gt;\n\n\nNow comments can be enabled by adding comments: true to the front matter.\n\n---\nlayout:   post\ntitle:    Hello World\ncomments: true\n---\n\n\nYou can enable comments for entire classes of pages by using front matter defaults.\nE.g. to enable comments on all posts, add to your config file:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      type: posts\n    values:\n      comments: true\n\n\nEnabling Google Analytics\nEnabling Google Analytics is as simple as setting the google_analytics key.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ngoogle_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXX-X\n\n\nTo remove Google Analytics and all associated code from the site, set the google_analytics key to false.\n\nUsing a custom analytics provider\nIf you want to use a different analytics provider such as Matomo, you can add its code snippet to _includes/my-body.html (create if it doesn’t exist).\nThe default file contains an example.\n\nChanging built-in strings\nYou can change the wording of built-in strings like “Related Posts” or “Read more” in _data/strings.yml.\n\nIf you are using the gem-based version the file doesn’t exist, but you can get the default file here.\n\nYou will frequently find markers like &lt;!--post_title--&gt;.\nYou can place them freely within your string and they will be replaced with the content they refer to.\n\nYou may also use this feature to translate the theme into different languages.\nIn this case you should also set the lang key to your config file, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nlang: cc-ll\n\n\nwhere cc is the 2-letter country code and ll specifies a 2-letter location code, e.g.: de-at.\n\nYou may also change the strings used for formatting dates and times (look out for the date_formats key), but be aware that the values you provide need to be valid Ruby format directives.\n\nAdding legal documents\nIf you have pages for contact data, privacy policy, cookie policy, etc. you can add links to them in the footer by listing them under the legal key in your config file as follows:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nlegal:\n  - title: Impress\n    url:  /impress/\n  - title: Cookies Policy\n    url:  /cookies-policy/\n\n\nWhen using Hydejack’s offline feature, the pages listed here will be downloaded and cached when loading the page for the first time.\n\nEnabling math blocks\n\nHydejack supports math blocks with either KaTeX or MathJax.\n\nThe MathJax implementation comes with a client-side runtime and works on GitHub Pages. \nIt is the more heavy-weight of the two and doesn’t work without JavaScript enabled. \nDue to the size of the complete MathJax package, it only works partially with offline support enabled.\n\nThe KaTeX implementation pre-renders the KaTeX output during site building.\nIt’s more lightweight because it does not ship a client-side runtime and therefore works without JavaScript.\nIn my opinion, it is the more elegant solution, but it requires a JavaScript runtime on the machine that builds the site,\ni.e. it does not work on GitHub Pages.\n\nYou can switch between the two implementations by changing the kramdown.math_engine key to either katex or mathjax in your config file.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nkramdown:\n  math_engine:         katex\n  math_engine_opts:    {}\n\n\nThe KaTeX implementation also requires the kramdown-math-katex gem in your Gemfile. \nIf you intend to use MathJax instead, this step is not required.\n\n# file: `Gemfile`\ngem \"kramdown-math-katex\"\n\n\nThere are a couple of things to know about this gem:\n\n  It is not supported on GitHub Pages. \nYou have to build the site on your machine before uploading to GitHub,\nor use a more permissive cloud building tool such as Netlify.\n  You need some kind of JavaScript runtime on your machine.\nUsually installing NodeJS will suffice. \nAlternatively, adding gem \"duktape\" will also do.\nFor more, see https://github.com/kramdown/math-katex#documentation\n\n\nBefore you add math content, remember to run bundle install and restart Jekyll.\n\nAdding custom Favicons and App Icons\nChanging the Favicon\nBy default, Hydejack will use the Favicon from /assets/icons/favicon.ico and Apple Touch Icon from /assets/icons/icon-192x192.png.\nYou can either override these files, or override the path in the config file via favicon and app_touch_icon keys:\n\n# file: \"_config.yml\"\nfavicon: /favicon.ico\napple_touch_icon: /assets/img/logo.png\n\n\nChanging the App Icons\nBy default, Hydejack includes its own favicon, as well as app icons in 8 different resolutions.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Resolution\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      icon-512x512.png\n      512x512\n    \n    \n      icon-384x384.png\n      384x384\n    \n    \n      icon-192x192.png\n      192x192\n    \n    \n      icon-152x152.png\n      152x152\n    \n    \n      icon-144x144.png\n      144x144\n    \n    \n      icon-128x128.png\n      128x128\n    \n    \n      icon-96x96.png\n      96x96\n    \n    \n      icon-72x72.png\n      72x72\n    \n  \n\n\nTo change the default icons you have to replce all of them. To make this manageable, I recommend using the following tools:\n\nFirst, use the Maskable.app Editor to confine your logo/picture to the “minimum safe area”. More on maskable app icons, see this article on web.dev. \nMake sure the base image is at least 512x512 pixels in size.\n\nThen use the Web App Manifest Generator to automatically resize the icons. \nUpload the icon downloaded from Maskable.app and then click “Generate .zip”. \nIn the zip, ignore the manifest.json and look for the icons folder. Copy it into the assets folder of your site.\n\nTo change the favicon, place your own favicon.ico (32x32, PNG) into assets/icons.\n\nAdding a cookies banner*\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nhydejack:\n  cookies_banner: true\n\n\nEnabling this setting will show a notice at the top of the page to new visitors.\nYou can change the wording of the notice in _data/strings.yml\nwith the cookies_banner.text and cookies_banner.okay keys:\n\n# file: `_data/strings.yml`\ncookies_banner:\n  text: This site uses cookies. [Markdown allowed](/cookies-policy/)!\n  okay: Okay\n\n\nEnabling newsletter boxes*\nTo enable showing newsletter subscription boxes below each post and project,\nprovide your Tinyletter username to the tinyletter key in the config file.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ntinyletter:  &lt;tinyletter username&gt;\n\n\nTo edit the content of the newsletter box, open _data/strings.yml, and change the entries under the tinyletter key.\n\nIf want to use a different mailing provider you can build your own form, and insert it into _includes/my-newsletter.html. The file includes an example form for MailChimp, where you need to fill in site.mailchimp.action and site.mailchimp.hidden_input (you can get these from MailChimp).\n\nTo build a completely new from, you can use the same CSS classes as Bootstrap. Note that only form, grid and utility classes are available. Check out Forms by Example for more examples.\n\nEnabling Dark Mode*\nBuyers of the PRO version have access to a dark-themed version of Hydejack.\n\nDark mode can be enabled in config.yml under the hydejack key and has three settings and two adjustments:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nhydejack:\n  dark_mode:\n    dynamic: true\n    sunrise: 6\n    sunset:  18\n    icon:    true\n    always:  false\n\n\nSetting dynamic, will enable dark mode based on the client’s local time (unlike location-based sunset calculations, this approach does not require a permission form the user). You can adjust sunrise and sunset to change when to show the light/dark theme.\n\nSetting icon will show a switch to alternate between the light and dark mode at the top of the page.\n\nFinally, setting always will cause dark mode to become the default theme at all times (combine with dynamic: false).\n\nContinue with Basics\n\n",

      "content": "How you install Hydejack depends on whether you start a new site, \nor change the theme of an existing site.\n\n\n  New sites\n  Existing sites    \n      Troubleshooting\n    \n  \n  GitHub Pages\n  Running locally\n\n\nNew sites\nFor new sites, the best way to get started with Hydejack is via the Starter Kit. \nIt comes with a documented config file and example content that gets you started quickly.\n\nIf you have a GitHub account, fork the Hydejack Starter Kit repository. \nOtherwise download the Starter Kit and unzip them somewhere on your machine.\n\nIf you bought the PRO Version of Hydejack, use the contents of the starter-kit folder instead.\n\nIn addition to the docs here, you can follow the quick start guide in the Starter Kit.\n\nYou can now jump to running locally.\n\nYou can now also  directly.\n\nExisting sites\nIf you have an existing site that you’d like to upgrade to Hydejack you can install the theme via bundler.\nAdd the following to your Gemfile:\n\n# file: `Gemfile`\ngem \"jekyll-theme-hydejack\"\n\n\nIf you bought the PRO Version of Hydejack, copy the #jekyll-theme-hydejack folder into the root folder of your site,\nand add the following to your Gemfile instead:\n\n# file: `Gemfile`\ngem \"jekyll-theme-hydejack\", path: \"./#jekyll-theme-hydejack\"\n\n\nThe folder is prefixed with a # to indicate that this folder is different from regular Jekyll content. \nThe # char was choosen specifically because it is on of the four characters ignored by Jekyll by default (., _ , #, ~).\n\nIn your config file, change the theme to Hydejack:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ntheme: jekyll-theme-hydejack\n\n\nHydejack comes with a default configuration file that takes care most of the configuration,\nbut it pays off to check out the example config file in the Starter Kit to see what’s available.\n\nYou can now jump to running locally.\n\nTroubleshooting\nIf your existing site combines theme files with your content (as did previous verisons of Hydejack/PRO),\nmake sure to delete the following folders:\n\n\n  _layouts\n  _includes\n  _sass\n  assets\n\n\nThe assets folder most likely includes theme files as well as your personal/content files. \nMake sure to only delete files that belong to the old theme!\n\nGitHub Pages\nIf you want to build your site on GitHub Pages, check out the gh-pages branch in the Hydejack Starter Kit repo.\n\nFor existing sites, you can instead set the remote_theme key as follows:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nremote_theme: hydecorp/hydejack@v9.1.6\n\n\nMake sure the plugins list contains jekyll-include-cache (create if it doesn’t exist):\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-include-cache\n\n\nTo run this configuration locally, make sure the following is part of your Gemfile:\n\n# file: `Gemfile`\ngem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins\ngem \"jekyll-include-cache\", group: :jekyll_plugins\n\n\nNote that Hydejack has a reduced feature set when built on GitHub Pages. \nSpecifically, using KaTeX math formulas doesn’t work when built in this way.\n\nRunning locally\nMake sure you’ve cded into the directory where _config.yml is located.\nBefore running for the first time, dependencies need to be fetched from RubyGems:\n\n$ bundle install\n\n\nIf you are missing the bundle command, you can install Bundler by running gem install bundler.\n\nNow you can run Jekyll on your local machine:\n\n$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n\n\nand point your browser to http://localhost:4000 to see Hydejack in action.\n\nContinue with Config\n\n",

The method depends on how you’ve installed Hydejack.\n\n\n  Free version\n  PRO Version\n  GitHub Pages\n\n\nBefore upgrading to v7+, make sure you’ve read the CHANGELOG,\nespecially the part about the license change!\n\nFree version\nUpgrading the free version of the theme is as easy as running\n\nbundle update jekyll-theme-hydejack\n\n\nPRO Version\n\nIn v9, the structure of Hydejack PRO sites has changed. If you’re looking to upgrade from v8 or earlier, \ncheck out Installation for existing sites instead.\n\nBuyers of the PRO version will find the files necessary for an upgrade in the #jekyll-theme-hydejack folder of the downloaded zip archive.\nTo upgrade, simply overwrite the existing theme folder in the root directory of your site with the new one, then run\n\nbundle update jekyll-theme-hydejack\n\n\nIf you’ve modified any of Hydejack’s files in #jekyll-theme-hydejack, your changes will most likely be overwritten\nand you have to apply them again. Make sure you’ve made a backup before overwriting any files.\n\nGitHub Pages\nWhen building on GitHub Pages, upgrading Hydejack is as simple as setting the remote_theme key in _config.yml to the desired version.\n\nremote_theme: hydecorp/hydejack@v9.1.6\n\n\nTo use the latest version on the v9 branch on each build, you can use  hydecorp/hydejack@v9.\n\nContinue with Config\n",

      "content": "Hydejack offers a few additional features to markup your content.\nDon’t worry, these are merely CSS classes added with kramdown’s {:...} syntax,\nso that your content remains compatible with other Jekyll themes.\n\n\n  A word on building speeds\n  Adding a table of contents\n  Adding notes\n  Adding large text\n  Adding large images\n  Adding image captions\n  Adding large quotes\n  Adding faded text\n  Adding tables    \n      Scroll table\n      Small tables\n    \n  \n  Adding code blocks\n  Adding math    \n      Inline\n      Block\n    \n  \n\n\nFor an introduction to markdown in general, see Mastering Markdown and kramdown Syntax.\n\nA word on building speeds\nIf building speeds are a problem, try using the --incremental flag, e.g.\n\nbundle exec jekyll serve --incremental\n\n\nFrom the Jekyll docs (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  Enable the experimental incremental build feature. Incremental build only re-builds posts and pages that have changed, resulting in significant performance improvements for large sites, but may also break site generation in certain cases.\n\n\nThe breakage occurs when you create new files or change filenames.\nAlso, changing the title, category, tags, etc. of a page or post will not be reflected in pages\nother then the page or post itself.\nThis makes it ideal for writing new posts and previewing changes, but not setting up new content.\n\nAdding a table of contents\nYou can add a generated table of contents to any page by adding {:toc} below a list.\n\nMarkdown:\n* this unordered seed list will be replaced by the toc\n{:toc}\n\n\nYou can also create your table of contents as an ordered list (note the 1. instead of *):\n\n1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc\n{:toc}\n\n\nThe width of the display has to be larger than 1665px for the ToC to become sticky.\nOtherwise, the ToC will appear where the seed list is placed in the document.\nTo show the table of contents only on large displays (&gt; 1665px) use the following:\n\n* this unordered seed list will be replaced by the toc \n{:toc .large-only}\n\n\nA sticky table of contents will reduce the amount of space freed up by the no_break_layout: false setting.\nThis is necessary to ensure large code blocks or tables don’t overlap with the ToC.\n\nAdding notes\nYou can add a note by adding the note class to a paragraph.\n\nExample:\n\nYou can add a note.\n\nMarkdown:\nYou can add a note.\n{:.note}\n\n\nEdit the note key in _data/strings.yml to change the wording of the default label.\nTo add a note with a specific label, add a title attribute:\n\nA custom label.\n{:.note title=\"Attention\"}\n\n\nA custom label.\n\nAdding large text\nYou can add large text by adding the lead class to the paragraph.\n\nExample:\n\nYou can add large text.\n\nMarkdown:\nYou can add large text.\n{:.lead}\n\n\nAdding large images\nYou can make an image span the full width by adding the lead class.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nMarkdown:\n![Full-width image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x100){:.lead width=\"800\" height=\"100\" loading=\"lazy\"}\n\n\nIt is recommended to provide the dimension of the image via the width and height attributes, \nso that browsers can calculate the layout before the images are loaded. Combining this with the loading=\"lazy\" attribute\nallows modern browsers to load the images just-in-time as the users scrolls.\n\nPrevious versions of Hydejack shipped with a custom JavaScript-based lazy loading solution,\nbut it has been removed in v9 in favor of this more standards-based approach.\n\nAdding image captions\nYou can add captions to large images by adding the figcaption class to the paragraph after the image:\n\n\n\nAn optional caption for an image.\n\nMarkdown:\n![Full-width image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x100){:.lead width=\"800\" height=\"100\" loading=\"lazy\"}\n\nA caption for an image.\n{:.figcaption}\n\n\nAdding large quotes\nYou can make a quote “pop out” by adding the lead class.\n\nExample:\n\n\n  You can make a quote “pop out”.\n\n\nMarkdown:\n&gt; You can make a quote \"pop out\".\n{:.lead}\n\n\nAdding faded text\nYou can gray out text by adding the faded class. Use this sparingly and for information that is not essential, as it is more difficult to read.\n\nExample:\n\nI’m faded, faded, faded.\n\nMarkdown:\nI'm faded, faded, faded.\n{:.faded}\n\n\nAdding tables\nAdding tables is straightforward and works just as described in the kramdown docs, e.g.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n    \n  \n\n\nMarkdown:\n| Default aligned |Left aligned| Center aligned  | Right aligned  |\n|-----------------|:-----------|:---------------:|---------------:|\n| First body part |Second cell | Third cell      | fourth cell    |\n\n\nHowever, it gets tricker when adding large tables.\nIn this case, Hydejack will break the layout and grant the table the entire available screen width to the right:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n    \n    \n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n    \n    \n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n    \n    \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nTables adopts to the font size! You can decrease the size of the table by adding the smaller CSS class. Put {:.smaller} below the Markdown table, or add class=\"smaller\" to a HTML table.\n\nScroll table\nIf the extra space still isn’t enough, the table will receive a scrollbar.\nIt is browser default behavior to break the lines inside table cells to fit the content on the screen.\nBy adding the scroll-table class on a table, the behavior is changed to never break lines inside cells, e.g:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n    \n    \n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n    \n    \n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n    \n    \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can add the scroll-table class to a markdown table by putting {:.scroll-table} in line directly below the table.\nTo add the class to a HTML table, add the it to the class attribute of the table tag, e.g. &lt;table class=\"scroll-table\"&gt;.\n\nSmall tables\nIf a table is small enough to fit the screen even on small screens, you can add the stretch-table class\nto force a table to use the entire available content width. Note that stretched tables can no longer be scrolled.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n    \n  \n\n\nAn optional caption for a table\n\nYou can add the stretch-table class to a markdown table by putting {:.stretch-table} in line directly below the table.\nTo add the class to a HTML table, add the it to the class attribute of the table tag, e.g. &lt;table class=\"stretch-table\"&gt;.\n\nJust like images, you can add captions to tables by adding the figcaption class to the paragraph after the table.\n\nAn optional caption for a table\n{:.figcaption}\n\n\nAdding code blocks\nTo add a code block without syntax highlighting, simply indent 4 spaces (regular markdown).\nFor code blocks with code highlighting, use ~~~&lt;language&gt;. This syntax is also supported by GitHub.\nFor more information and a list of supported languages, see Rouge.\n\nYou can give each code block a filename, by making the first line in the block a comment of the form File: \"dir/filename.ext\". Use either single quotes ', double quotes \", or backticks ` to surround the filename.\n\nExample:\n\n// file: \"code-block.js\"\n// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console\n\n// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those\n// arguments\nvar adder = new Function(\"a\", \"b\", \"return a + b\");\n\n// Call the function\nadder(2, 6);\n// &gt; 8\n\n\nAn optional caption for a code block\n\nMarkdown:\n\n~~~js\n// file: \"code-block.js\"\n// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console\n\n// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those\n// arguments\nvar adder = new Function(\"a\", \"b\", \"return a + b\");\n\n// Call the function\nadder(2, 6);\n// &gt; 8\n~~~\n\nAn optional caption for a code block\n{:.figcaption}\n\n\nDO NOT use Jekyll’s { % highlight % } ... { % endhighlight % } syntax, especially together with the linenos option.\nThe generated table to render the line numbers does not have a CSS class or any other way of differentiating it from regular tables,\nso that the styles above apply, resulting in a broken page.\nWhat’s more, the output from highlight tags isn’t even valid HTML, nesting pre tags inside pre tags,\nwhich will in break the site during minification.\nYou can read more about it here and\nhere.\n\nAdding math\nBefore adding math blocks, make sure you’ve set up math support.\n\nInline\nExample:\n\nLorem ipsum \\(f(x) = x^2\\).\n\nMarkdown:\nLorem ipsum $$ f(x) = x^2 $$.\n\n\nBlock\nExample:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\phi(x,y) &amp;= \\phi \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \\sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \\right) \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \\phi(e_i, e_j)            \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n                 \\phi(e_1, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_1, e_n) \\\\\n                 \\vdots          &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots         \\\\\n                 \\phi(e_n, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_n, e_n)\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n                 y_1    \\\\\n                 \\vdots \\\\\n                 y_n\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nAn optional caption for a math block\n\nMarkdown:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} %!!15\n  \\phi(x,y) &amp;= \\phi \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \\sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \\right) \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \\phi(e_i, e_j)            \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n                 \\phi(e_1, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_1, e_n) \\\\\n                 \\vdots          &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots         \\\\\n                 \\phi(e_n, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_n, e_n)\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n                 y_1    \\\\\n                 \\vdots \\\\\n                 y_n\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAn optional caption for a math block\n{:.figcaption}\n\n\nKaTeX does not support the align and align* environments.\nInstead, aligned should be used, e.g. \\begin{aligned} ... \\end{aligned}.\n\nContinue with Scripts\n\n",

      "title": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE",
      
      "content": "Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nhttp://fsf.org/\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom\nto share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains\nfree software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use\nthe GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies\nalso to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\nit to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you\nhave certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\nof others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and\nauthors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the\nmanufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the\naim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The\nsystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for\nindividuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the\npractice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in\nother domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\ndomains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the\nfreedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\ncould make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and\n“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of\nthe earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user\nthrough a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\nconveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of\na work.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work’s\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork.\n\n2. Basic Permissions\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\nwithout conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\nthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\nfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\nterms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for\nyou must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\ncontrol, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\ncopyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes\nit unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such\ncircumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with\nrespect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\nthe work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\n\n  The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n  The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under\nsection 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4\nto “keep intact all notices”.\n  You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n  If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\n\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\n\n  Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n  Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\nSource from a network server at no charge.\n  Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n  Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n  Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\nprovided you inform other peers where the object code and\nCorresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general\npublic at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\nfamily, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for\nincorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a\nconsumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of\ncoverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,\n“normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of\nproduct, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\nin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\nto use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of\nwhether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\nnon-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\nmode of use of the product.\n\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\ninstall and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User\nProduct from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The\ninformation must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of\nthe modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\nsolely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or\nupdates for a work that has been modified or installed by the\nrecipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or\ninstalled. Access to a network may be denied when the modification\nitself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\nor violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\nnetwork.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\nof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n\n  Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n  Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n  Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\nor requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n  Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\nor authors of the material; or\n  Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n  Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions\nof it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,\nfor any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\nimpose on those licensors and authors.\n\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further\nrestrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the\nabove requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\na copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned\nor controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you\nare a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\nbusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment to the\nthird party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\nwork, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\nwho would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\nlicense (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\nyou (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in\nconnection with specific products or compilations that contain the\ncovered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\nlicense was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\nthis License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to\nterms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\nfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could\nsatisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\nfrom conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public\nLicense “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\nof the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public\nstatement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to\nchoose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\nCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\nTO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n",

This can be enabled per-page in the fort matter:\n\ninvert_sidebar: true\n\n\nCode Block Headers\nCode blocks can now have headers:\n\n// file: 'hello-world.js'\nconsole.log('Hello World!');\n\n\nHeaders are added by making the first line a comment of the form (file|title): ['\"].*['\"], e.g.:\n\n~~~js\n// file: 'hello-world.js'\nconsole.log('Hello World!');\n~~~\n\n\nCode blocks with and without headers now also come with a copy button. \nIn the case of header-less code blocks, the button only shows on hover to prevent potential overlap.\n\nResume Download Buttons\nResumes can now have download buttons:\n\n\n\nResumes can now have download buttons.\n\nThe documentation has been updated with a chapter on how to configure the buttons.\n\nSERP Breadcrumbs\nAdded breadcrumbs above page title:\n\n\n\nBread crumbs are now shown above each page title.\n\nNote that this requires a directory-like URL structure on your entire site, \notherwise the intermediate links will point to nonexisting sites.\n\nOn a side note, Hydejack now has built-in tooltips for abbreviations like SERP (activated via tap/click).\nSee Example Content on how to add them to your content.\n\nLast Modified At\nBlog posts can now have a “last modified at” date in the sub title row.\n\n\n\nNote that this depends on the last_modified_at property of the page, which must be either set manually in the frontmatter (not recommended), or via a plugin like jekyll-last-modified-at. Note that the later is not available when building on GitHub Pages and can increase build times.\n\nClap Button Preview\nI’ve been trying something new with getclaps.app, a feedback and analytics tool for personal sites like those powered by Hydejack.\n\n\n\nIt is a separate product from Hydejack and not enabled by default. Because it depends on a backend component, it requires a monthly fee. \nIf enabled, it is placed below posts and pages where the dingbat character (❖) used to be.\n\nI can’t claim that this product is fully baked (feedback welcome), but I’ve been using it on my personal site and here for the last couple of months with no issues.\nFor more, see the dedicated website.\n\n\n\nThere are many more changes and bugfixes in 9.1. See the CHANGELOG for details.\n\nCredits\n\nPhoto by JJ Ying on Unsplash\n\n",
