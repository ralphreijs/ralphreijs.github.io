I advise companies and manage startups with a strong, senior mentality bringing 25+ years of experience in bleeding-edge technology. \nI have worked in 40+ projects in corporate environments as a Senior Solution Architect in IT Service Management. For the last 14+ years I have specialised in Startups as well, many of which in the Blockchain scene, and I have been involved with Bitcoin since 2010. \nIn 2017 I was a founding (and core team-) member of Pillar, one of the first cryptocurrency ICOs, where we raised $27M in 60 hours. In 2018 I was a core team member of Jinbi, an ICO where we raised $47M over 6 months.\nCurrently I‚Äôm primarily CTO of Apostille USA, a 100% automated platform for Apostille of Legal Documents; which reduces processing time from months to days. Created in March 2023, we‚Äôve had clients since the first month, and have been profitable since month four, all without external funding.\n\n\n    \n        \n        R√©sum√©\n    \n\n\nClients\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nMy Previous Projects\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                Product Development\n            \n            \n                Projects where I served as CPO or CTO\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                Enterprise Architecture\n            \n            \n                IT Service Management Projects\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                Blockchain\n            \n            \n                Blockchain Startups &amp; Projects\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                Security &amp; Infrastructure\n            \n            \n                Security, Networking, Pentesting projects\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                Mobile Apps\n            \n            \n                Mobile Appplication development projects\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                Websites\n            \n            \n                Website design &amp; development projects\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                Artificial Intelligence\n            \n            \n                Adventures with Stable Diffusion\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                Personal Interests\n            \n            \n                Hacking, Tinkering, Drones, 3D Printing, Bitcoin.

      "content": "This project was an experiment to see how much one can detect and prove that certain domains are cheating Google PageRank by running Private Blog Networks (PBNs). It turned out quite successful, and over the course of about 6 months Google took down 100,000‚Äôs of backlinks to domains after they were exposed to be coming from PBNs with a 100% accuracy. \nThe premise was simple: ‚ÄúIf a domain is useless, all of its outbound links to other domains are useless‚Äù. If you identify a domain with large numbers of backlinks to be a domain that no human would ever visit or find remotely interesting to spend time on, you likely found a PBN site. \nI traced inbound backlinks to powerful websites, and checked from what other domains their links were coming. Many of them were using dozens of domains with high Domain Authority that offered no useful information to a human, but insane amounts of backlinks for Google‚Äôs crawlers. \nThis gave me an incredible insight into what powers the ‚Äúlink juice‚Äù for domains, and allowed me to see who is cheating (using backlinks from PBNs) and who isn‚Äôt (having organic backlinks). \nIt also allowed me to report to Google, with high precision, what domains could be easily verified to be part of a PBN, and what backlinks should therefor be considered to solely exist for the purpose of ‚Äúmanipulating pagerank‚Äù.
