I advise and manage startups with a strong, senior mentality and 25+ years of experience in bleeding-edge technology. \nFor 20+ years I have worked in corporate environments as a Senior Solution Architect in IT Service Management. For the last 14+ years I have worked on Startups as well, many of which in the Blockchain scene, as I have been involved with Bitcoin since 2010. \nIn 2017 I was a founding (and core team-) member of Pillar, one of the first cryptocurrency ICOs, where we raised $27M in 60 hours. In 2018 I was a core team member of Jinbi, an ICO where we raised $47M over 6 months.\nCurrently I‚Äôm CTO of Apostille USA, a 100% automated platform for Apostille of Legal Documents; reducing processing time to days instead of months.

The software was originally called PNMS (Problem Network Management System) for MVS / 3270 systems, and the GUI was based on ‚Äúlines‚Äù as to maintain backward compatibility with text-based UIs.\n\n\n\nPeregrine Systems ServiceCenter v6 (2002)\n\nIn 2005, HP acquired Peregrine Systems and made their various software products a part of the HP OpenView portfolio. ServiceCenter was then called ServiceManager, and it received a number of big updates that gave it less of a text-based GUI feeling.\n\n\n\nHP ServiceManager v7 (2007)\n\nFrom around 2011, the ServiceNow platform (created by the former CTO of Peregrine Systems) had taken of a large share of the corporate IT Service Management market, and many corporations were making the switch.\n\n\n\nServiceNow (2015)\n",

This certification is required by international law, and it is issued by a government in accordance with the Hague Convention of 1961. The purpose of an apostille is to ensure that a document can be legally recognized and accepted in foreign countries.\n\nIn some cases, if the country of intended use does not participate in the Hague Convention, documents being sent to that country can still be authenticated or certified. This process can be time-consuming and complicated, and that‚Äôs why we developed a completely automated &amp; integrated Document Apostille service, drastically removing bureacucracy and reducing processing times. Revolutionary in the industry.\nAll of the following aspects have been automated:\n\n  Order process\n  Payment process\n  Shipping Label creation\n  Fulfillment (physical apostille in all 50 U.S. states via local partners)\n  Delivery\n  Automatic fixing of 98% of exceptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Apostille USA: Place an Order in Less than a Minute!
