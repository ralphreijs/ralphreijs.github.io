I advise and manage startups with a strong, senior mentality and 25+ years of experience in bleeding-edge technology. \nFor 20+ years I have worked in 40+ projects at corporate environments as a Senior Solution Architect in IT Service Management. For the last 14+ years I have worked on Startups as well, many of which in the Blockchain scene, as I have been involved with Bitcoin since 2010. \nIn 2017 I was a founding (and core team-) member of Pillar, one of the first cryptocurrency ICOs, where we raised $27M in 60 hours. In 2018 I was a core team member of Jinbi, an ICO where we raised $47M over 6 months.\nCurrently I‚Äôm CTO of Apostille USA, a 100% automated platform for Apostille of Legal Documents; which reduces processing time from months to days.

      "content": "This project was an experiment to see how much one can detect and prove that certain domains are cheating Google PageRank by running Private Blog Networks (PBNs). It turned out quite successful, and over the course of about 6 months Google took down 100,000‚Äôs of backlinks to domains after they were exposed to be coming from PBNs with a 100% accuracy. \nThe premise was simple: ‚ÄúIf a domain is useless, all of its outbound links to other domains are useless‚Äù. If you identify a domain with large numbers of backlinks to be a domain that no human would ever visit or find remotely interesting to spend time on, you likely found a PBN site. \nI traced inbound backlinks to powerful websites, and checked from what other domains their links were coming. Many of them were using dozens of domains with high Domain Authority that offered no useful information to a human, but insane amounts of backlinks for Google‚Äôs crawlers. \nThis gave me an incredible insight into what powers the ‚Äúlink juice‚Äù for domains, and allowed me to see who is cheating (using backlinks from PBNs) and who isn‚Äôt (having organic backlinks). \nIt also allowed me to report to Google, with high precision, what domains could be easily verified to be part of a PBN, and what backlinks should therefor be considered to solely exist for the purpose of ‚Äúmanipulating pagerank‚Äù. Once a domain is known to be part of a PBN, all of its outbound links are part as well.\n\nBacklink Analysis Reports\n\n\n\nAn Domain Report containing a Backlink Analysis (sent to Google) on Pastebin - Header (2017)\n\n\n\nDomain report - Target Summary (2017)\n\n\n\nDomain report - Identified Paid Link resellers and IP-Addresses used by Target (2017)\n\n\n\nDomain report - Identified Private Blog Networks (PBNs) used by Target (2017)\n\n\n\nPBN Party report - Summary of all related Domain Reports (2017)\n\nBacklink Assassin Frontend\n\n\n\nBacklink Assassin Recon, where PBN domains are identified (2017)\n\n\n\nBacklink Assassin - Domains Dashboard (2017)\n\n\n\nBacklink Assassin - PBN Party (owner of PBN domains) that has sold backlinks (2017)\n\n\n\nBacklink Assassin - PBN Party (owner of PBN domains) that has sold backlinks (2017)\n\n\n\nBacklink Assassin - PBN Party that has paid for backlinks (2017)\n\n\n\nBacklink Assassin - Domain Details (2017)\n\nElasticSearch and Kibana\n\n\n\nElasticSearch on the backend, indexing all backlinks data (2017)\n\n\n\nElasticSearch on the backend, processing all backlinks data (2017)\n\n\n\nKibana Dashboard with backlinks statistics (2017)\n\n\n\nKibana Dashboard with backlinks statistics (2017)\n\n\n\nKibana Dashboard with backlinks statistics (2017)\n\n\n\nKibana Dashboard with backlinks statistics (2017)\n\n\n\nTop 5 Cheaters (2017)\n\nData Processing Scripts\n\n\n\nBacklinks data processing (getting intelligence out of existing data) (2017)\n\n\n\nBacklinks data processing (getting intelligence out of existing data) (2017)\n",

This process can be time-consuming and complicated, and that‚Äôs why we developed a completely automated &amp; integrated Document Apostille service, drastically removing bureacucracy and reducing processing times.
