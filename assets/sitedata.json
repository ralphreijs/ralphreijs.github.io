The PRO version is a one-time payment that gives you the right to use it forever.\n\nHydejack is all static sites. HTML. All you need is a web server — any web server — to have a professional web presence that lasts a lifetime.\n\nA Free Blogging Theme\nHydejack started out as a free blogging theme for Jekyll — and continues to be so.\n\n\n\nAn Impressive Portfolio\nA portfolio that’s guaranteed to be impressive — no matter what you put into it.\n\n\n\nA Printable Resume\nGet a resume that’s consistent across the board — whether it’s on the web, mobile, print, or PDF.\n\n\n\nFront and center page of a print resume generated by Hydejack.\n\nJust Markdown\nWrite all content with Markdown. Hydejack gives you additional CSS classes to stylize your content, without losing compatibility with other Jekyll themes.\n\nJust Markup\nHydejack boasts a plethora of modern JavaScript, but make no mistake: It’s still a plain old web page at its core. It works without JavaScript and you can even view it in a text-based browser like w3m:\n\n\n\nThe Hydejack blog, as seen by the text browser w3m.\n\nSyntax Highlighting\nHydejack features syntax highlighting, powered by Rouge.\n\n&lt;!-- file: `_includes/my-body.html` --&gt;\n&lt;script type=\"module\"&gt;\n  document.querySelector(\"hy-push-state\").addEventListener(\"hy-push-state-load\", () =&gt; {\n    const supportsCodeHighlights = false; // TBD!!\n  });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nCode blocks can have a filename and a caption.\n\nBeautiful Math\nThey say math is beautiful — and with Hydejack’s math support it’s guaranteed to also look beautiful:\n\nϕ(x,y)=ϕ(∑i=1nxiei,∑j=1nyjej)=∑i=1n∑j=1nxiyjϕ(ei,ej)=(x1,…,xn)(ϕ(e1,e1)⋯ϕ(e1,en)⋮⋱⋮ϕ(en,e1)⋯ϕ(en,en))(y1⋮yn)\\begin{aligned}\n  \\phi(x,y) &amp;= \\phi \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \\sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \\right) \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \\phi(e_i, e_j)            \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n                 \\phi(e_1, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_1, e_n) \\\\\n                 \\vdots          &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots         \\\\\n                 \\phi(e_n, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_n, e_n)\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n                 y_1    \\\\\n                 \\vdots \\\\\n                 y_n\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}ϕ(x,y)​=ϕ(i=1∑n​xi​ei​,j=1∑n​yj​ej​)=i=1∑n​j=1∑n​xi​yj​ϕ(ei​,ej​)=(x1​,…,xn​)​ϕ(e1​,e1​)⋮ϕ(en​,e1​)​⋯⋱⋯​ϕ(e1​,en​)⋮ϕ(en​,en​)​​​y1​⋮yn​​​​\n\nHydejack uses KaTeX to efficiently render math.\n\nFeatures\n\nAn incomplete list of features included in all versions of Hydejack:\n\n\n  Responsive layout with unique design features for every screen size\n  Cover Pages for a stunning first impression.\n  Customizable sidebar and touch-enabled drawer menu\n  Single Page Web App-style page loading\n  Advanced FLIP animations, inspired by Material Design\n  Good Google PageSpeed Score1\n  Syntax highlighting, powered by Rouge\n  LaTeX math blocks, rendered with ether KaTeX or MathJax at your choice\n  Soft-coded labels: Change wording or translate to other languages via a single file\n  Support for categories and tags\n  Author section below each article and support for multiple authors\n  Built-in icons for many social networks\n  Simple and semantic HTML + Structured Data\n  Works with GitHub Pages out of the box2\n\n\nDownload\n\nThere are two versions of Hydejack: The Free Version includes basic blogging functionality and most of Hydejack’s Features, such as dynamic page loading and advanced animations.\n\nThe PRO Version includes additional features for professionals, such as a portfolio, resume, Dark Mode, Forms, Built-In Search and customizable cookie banners.\n\nThe table below shows what’s included in each version:\n\n\n  \n    \n       \n      Free\n      PRO\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Blog\n      ✔\n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Features\n      ✔\n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Documentation\n      ✔\n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Dark Mode\n      ✔\n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Portfolio\n       \n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Printable Resume\n       \n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Built-In Search\n       \n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Custom Forms\n       \n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Grid layout\n       \n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Offline Support\n       \n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Table of Contents3\n       \n      ✔\n    \n    \n      Cookie Banner\n       \n      ✔\n    \n    \n      No Hydejack Branding\n       \n      ✔\n    \n    \n      License\n      GPL-3.0\n      PRO\n    \n    \n      Source\n      GitHub\n      Included\n    \n    \n      Price\n      Free\n      $99 One-Time Purchase4\n    \n  \n  \n    \n       \n      Download\n      Buy PRO\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nGet It Now\n\nUse the the form below to purchase Hydejack PRO:\n\nLoading…\n\n\n  \n    \n      Actual page load speed depends on your hosting provider, location, resolution and format of images, usage of 3rd party plugins, and other factors. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Some limitations apply, most notably the need to use use MathJax instead of KaTeX for math block rendering. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Large screens (&gt; 1664px width) only. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n\n      Discounts may apply, check Gumroad for up-to-date pricing. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",
